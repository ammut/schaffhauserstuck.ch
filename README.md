This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

The goal is to keep it completely static so the website can be hosted and served by apache on my personal server.

To build, run:

```bash
next build && next export
```

The result will be in `./out`. Zip it and ship it.
